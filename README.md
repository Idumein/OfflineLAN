# OfflineLAN

This simple Fabric mod sets the online-mode value to false for the integrated server, so one is able to join a LAN world using a Mojang account.

This is already possible with dedicated servers, and you still need an official account to start the game client, therefore this mod doesn't enable any form of piracy.

## Installation

This mod works on versions 1.19 - 1.19.2 and most likely future versions.

This is a Fabric mod, so you'll need to install Fabric and the Fabric API mod before installing this mod.
